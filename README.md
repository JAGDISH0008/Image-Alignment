# Image-Alignment
In many applications, we have two images of the same scene or the same document, but they are not aligned. In other words, if you pick a feature (say a corner) on one image, the coordinates of the same corner in the other image is very different.
Image alignment (also known as image registration) is the technique of warping one image ( or sometimes both images ) so that the features in the two images line up perfectly.

The base Concept used is Homography
